# VitePress Portfolio Website and Blog

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic/lazarkulasevic.github.io/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic/lazarkulasevic.github.io/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

I have created my personal portfolio website using VitePress - Vite and Vue powered static site generator.

The source code is being maintained on the `master` branch, while the build is being deployed to `gh-pages` branch using Github Actions from where it's being hosted via Github Pages.
