It is the longest-running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, providing an independent view into the practices and capabilities that drive high performance in technology delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.devops-research.com/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">research</a> uses behavioral science to identify the most effective and efficient ways to develop and deliver software. It proved to be a great approach and engineers seem to love it. Many teams have adopted TBD so far. Just to name a well-known few, there is a Github team that works on github.com, Visual Studio Team Services, Google and Netflix.</p><h2 id="tbd-overview" tabindex="-1">TBD: Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#tbd-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TBD: Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By definition, trunk-based development is a git branching strategy that emphasizes the use of a single, shared code repository or &quot;trunk&quot; where all developers work on the same codebase. Rather than branching off separate copies of the code for each feature or bug fix, developers make changes directly to the main trunk, which is continuously integrated (CI) and continuously deployed (CD) to production. <br><br></p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="trunkbaseddevelopment.com"></p><p style="text-align:center;">trunkbaseddevelopment.com</p><h3 id="tbd-vs-gitflow" tabindex="-1">TBD vs Gitflow <a class="header-anchor" href="#tbd-vs-gitflow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TBD vs Gitflow&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Let’s make a brief comparison with the all-timer branching strategy – Gitflow. It uses at least two long-lived branches, main and develop. Feature branches are created off develop and merged back when completed, after which they usually keep living in the project.</p><p>Sometimes when changes are tested and testing fails, it would become increasingly difficult to figure out where the issue is exactly as developers are lost in a sea of commits. All of this could slow down the development process and release cycle. In that sense, gitflow is not an efficient approach for teams wanting to implement CI/CD.</p><p>Unlike Gitflow, TBD uses one and one only long-lived branch, main, off which short-lived feature branches are created. After the work is done on a feature branch, commits are squashed and merged as a single commit and the feature branch is deleted afterward. This enforces linear commit history.</p><p>Giflow provides more structure than TBD, but can be complex to manage and sometimes can lead to <em>merge hell</em>.</p><h3 id="tbd-pros-and-cons" tabindex="-1">TBD: Pros and Cons <a class="header-anchor" href="#tbd-pros-and-cons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TBD: Pros and Cons&quot;">​</a></h3><p>TBD is designed to promote collaboration, reduce complexity, and accelerate development cycles by eliminating the overhead of managing multiple branches and merges. By working directly on the trunk, developers can quickly integrate and test changes in a shared environment, which can help catch and resolve issues early in the development process.</p><p>However, there are a few unwanted risks that come along with the TBD. For instance, there is a risk of introducing breaking changes. Because all developers are working on the same codebase and changes made to the trunk can potentially break the existing code or cause conflicts with other changes. Nevertheless, this risk can be avoided by simply configuring some branch protection rules, especially the one that prevents merging branches that are not up to date with the main branch.</p><p>Secondly – the need for strong communication – well, technically this isn’t a risk, but rather a “downside” if you look at communication as an obstacle. With everyone working on the same trunk, it&#39;s crucial that teams communicate well and work collaboratively to avoid conflicts and ensure that changes are integrated smoothly. This can be challenging, especially for larger or distributed teams.</p><h3 id="practices-that-define-tbd" tabindex="-1">Practices that define TBD <a class="header-anchor" href="#practices-that-define-tbd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practices that define TBD&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At first glance, TBD seems to be a straightforward process. That’s not far from the truth, but this perk is determined by a set of practices that has to be conducted properly in order to ease the development and conserve the beauty of straightforwardness.</p><ul><li>Strict coding standards</li><li>Frequent code reviews</li><li>CI/CD with notifications</li><li>Automation</li></ul><p>Depending on the project, the CD abbreviation somewhere stands for continuous <em>delivery</em> and somewhere for continuous <em>deployment</em>. Key difference is a well-known agile ceremony – The Release Day – where continuous deployment excludes the need for that step because all changes are automatically deployed to production. However, the latter requires <em>feature flags</em> to be set in place.</p><p>What I’ve noticed during my career is that every team that uses TBD has a slightly different approach to CI/CD. And that is totally legit. After all, this is an organizational tool that should be adjusted to teams’ needs.</p><p>For example, I have orchestrated a set of pipelines for one of our projects in a manner that excludes additional test runners in the CD part to save on Github minutes and also put a version tag before the build step. It may look a bit inconvenient, but in fact, this setting perfectly suits my team’s needs. <br><br></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="CI/CD"></p><p style="text-align:center;">CI/CD Example Schema</p><p>These practices help to ensure that the code on the main branch is always in a stable, releasable state and that changes are thoroughly reviewed and tested before they are integrated. By following these practices, teams have a greater chance to produce high-quality code and ship changes more quickly to the test environment and their clients.</p><h2 id="building-ci-cd-pipelines-using-github-actions" tabindex="-1">Building CI/CD pipelines using Github Actions <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-ci-cd-pipelines-using-github-actions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building CI/CD pipelines using Github Actions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Github actions use workflows – Yaml files – located in the <code>.github/workflows/</code> root directory. There are lots of open-source Github actions that you can use in your workflow and drastically speed up the development of your pipeline. For example, widely used <code>actions/checkout@v3</code>, checks out your repository under <code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code>, so your workflow can access it. And there are many more, some of which we’re going to use in our workflows.</p><h3 id="continuous-integration-ci" tabindex="-1">Continuous Integration (CI) <a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-integration-ci" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Continuous Integration (CI)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In the CI part, we are going to make sure that no “smelly” or untested code can be merged. For that to work, we will define a pipeline that will test our code along the way and notify us if there is something wrong with it upon pull request (PR) creation. <br><br></p><p><img src="'+h+`" alt="Continuous Integration (CI)"></p><p style="text-align:center;">Continuous Integration (CI)</p><p>Besides the four PR checks on the graph, the workflow includes a few more steps that round up the CI. I have put all steps in a single job named Quality Check, set <code>ubuntu</code> as my job runner and configured a trigger to run this workflow upon PR creation.</p><p>First things first, checkout your repo. Then set environment variables in a separate step by running shell commands that extract engine versions from <code>package.json</code> – in this case node and pnpm – making them easily accessible within the job by simply calling <code>env.NODE_VERSION</code>. That way, we’re making <code>package.json</code> to be the single source of truth regarding engine versions. So we don’t need to update them manually through our workflows after updating them in the project.</p><p>Afterward, initiate node and pnpm with extracted versions, install dependencies and perform noted checks: lint code, Typescript check, unit tests are passing, line coverage is above 80%.</p><div class="language-yaml vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">yaml</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#6A737D;"># pull-request.yml</span></span>

In the Github repo settings, you can find a section dedicated to protecting branches. Pick the main branch and add the following rules:</p><ol><li>Require a pull request before merging <ul><li>Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed</li></ul></li><li>Require status checks to pass before merging <ul><li>Require branches to be up to date before merging</li><li>Quality Check (Github Actions)</li></ul></li><li>Require linear history</li><li>Restrict who can push to matching branches <ul><li>Restrict pushes that create matching branches</li><li>Admin account (Github Actions)</li></ul></li><li>Allow deletions</li></ol><p>Rules I would especially like to discuss are 2 and 3. The second rule prevents merging changes if the quality check is failed and the third one ensures that new commits are either squashed before merging or rebased onto the protected (main) branch. These two keep the code reliable and git history clean.</p><p align="center"><img width="360" src="`+p+'" alt="Git linear history"><span align="center">Git linear history</span></p><h3 id="continuous-delivery-cd" tabindex="-1">Continuous Delivery (CD) <a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-delivery-cd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Continuous Delivery (CD)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Following the same logic, with a slight advancement regarding workflow reusability, continuous delivery can be accomplished as well.
