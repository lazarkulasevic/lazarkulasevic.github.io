# [Brief Intro](/portfolio/#intro)

As a product-oriented software developer with a passion for front-end technologies, I bring a wealth of experience to the table. I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from enterprise-level applications to start-up ventures, and I have consistently demonstrated my ability to tackle complex technical challenges.

My expertise includes advanced data manipulation, the creation of clean front-end architectures, interactive data visualization, and the establishment of cost-effective CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I excel at fine-tuning projects such as pixel-perfect development.

Experience in splitting complex workloads into manageable, time-boxed tasks has allowed me to effectively organize and contribute to teams to achieve successful outcomes. I take pride in my ability to inspire colleagues and initiate projects that drive innovation and progress.

Overall, my technical and personal skills make me a valuable asset to any team in need of a seasoned software engineer who can deliver results while fostering a collaborative and innovative work environment.

### üìÅ VOD Platform

During my employment at Symphony, I came up with the solution. Soon after, a team was formed around the idea until we released the first version of the product that is currently in use. I took advantage of a fresh start to establish the processes of Trunk-based development and Kanban. Developed CI/CD pipelines and generously contributed to the project architecture and code quality ‚Äî over 80% coverage.

### Otisak (Fingerprint)

In under 4 months of part-time dedication I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform using Vue.js and Firebase as a serverless solution. The platform consists of two major parts ‚Äî website and dashboard. Website is open to the public, so feel free to check it out by clicking the link within the colorful card.

Dashboard, on the other hand, can be accessed only by registered users and admin. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization:

- Companies related analytics
- Company management
- Comment management
- User management
- Settings that includes database synchronization scripts (cost-effective solution)

### Mini side-projects

I used to build lots of mini apps, some of them to address certain problems and other just for fun. You can find all of these on [my Github](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic).
