# [Brief Intro](/portfolio/#intro)

Howdy! I am a product-oriented Software Engineer who has worked on various different projects from enterprise-level sized to startups. Some of them included quite serious challenges, such as advanced data manipulation, establishing clean front-end architecture for new product and technical features, interactive data visualization, establishing cost-effective CI/CD pipelines, but also some fine-tuning work such as pixel-perfect development.

Also, I have a master‚Äôs degree in Chemistry, so I can share with you a thing or two about science too.

# [Projects](/portfolio/#projects)

Major projects that I am especially proud of are shown using these colorful cards. Hover over each one to read the short description and visit the external link if you take an interest in some of them. Some of them that are marked as confidential will have üìÅ in front of their (made up) name.

### üìÅ VOD Platform

During my employment at Symphony, I came up with the solution. Soon after, a team was formed around the idea until we released the first version of the product that is currently in use. I took advantage of a fresh start to establish the processes of Trunk-based development and Kanban. Developed CI/CD pipelines and generously contributed to the project architecture and code quality ‚Äî over 80% coverage.

### Otisak (Fingerprint)

In under 4 months of part-time dedication I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform using Vue.js and Firebase as a serverless solution. The platform consists of two major parts ‚Äî website and dashboard. Website is open to the public, so feel free to check it out by clicking the link within the colorful card.

Dashboard, on the other hand, can be accessed only by registered users and admin. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization:

- Companies related analytics
- Company management
- Comment management
- User management
- Settings that includes database synchronization scripts (cost-effective solution)

### Mini side-projects

I used to build lots of mini apps, some of them to address certain problems and other just for fun. You can find all of these on [my Github](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic).
