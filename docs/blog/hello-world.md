Hello, world! This is my first blog post. Well, to be precise, this is my first blog post on *this* blog. I've decided to put a good use of the site generator such as VitePress and to see whether my posts here will get a good SEO. 

Funny enough, I also wanted to share with the developer community some JavaScript quirks that I've stumbled across in the past year or so.

So buckle up, folks! It's about to get crrraz... exactly the same as yesterday, only the internet got richer by one more software development blog. Yay. :man_technologist:
