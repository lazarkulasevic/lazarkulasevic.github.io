Crafting seamless and engaging user experiences is my forte.\n\n##  Work Experience\n\nWorked on a variety of projects, ranging from enterprise-level applications to start-up ventures. My technical expertise includes the creation of clean front-end architectures, interactive data presentation on the web and the establishment of necessary CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and provide good developer experience.\n\nSplitting complex workloads into manageable, time-boxed tasks has allowed me to effectively organize and contribute to team dynamics and ensure a successful incremental delivery. Also, I had a chance to prove my ability to inspire colleagues and initiate projects that drive innovation and progress.\n\n\n\n### Side Projects\n\nMy way of playing around with trending technologies and getting grasp of different industries, but at the same time creating something meaningful for humanity.\n\n####  [Nyegosh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyegosh) (AI-Gen, Software Development)\n\nNyegosh is a command-line tool that helps generate commit messages adhering to the Conventional Commit standard.Developed by the _DevBoost Lab_, where I was the team captain, during AI Hackathon organized within Symphony company, where innovative solutions and AI-driven tools were created to enhance developer workflows.\n\n####  [MiaDent](https://miadent.rs/en) (Dentistry)\n\nDental clinic website (Nov 2024) – Growing multiangular site, SEO-optimized for Serbian, English and German speaking users.\n\n####  Otisak.org Platform (Global Data Privacy Laws or GDPR)\n\nData Protection Platform (Sep – Dec 2021) – European Union funded project, conducted by Association Pravilaw that implements the Law on Personal Data Protection in Southern and Eastern Serbia municipalities – In under 4 months of part-time effort I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform which consists of two major parts — public website and private dashboard that can be accessed only by registered users and admins. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization: companies related analytics and their management, comments management, user management and settings page that includes database optimization scripts and sidebar ad setup section. Everything is hosted on Firebase, so maintenance costs remained around 0$ ([fallback URL](https://otisak-pravilaw.web.app/)).\n\nI used to build lots of mini apps back in the day, some of them to address certain problems and other just for fun (learning). You can find all of these on [my Github profile](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic).\n\n##  Tech Stack\n\n\n\n### Concepts and Platforms\n\n\n\n##  Get In Touch\n\nI believe my technical and personal skills make me a valuable asset to a team in need of an experienced software engineer who will deliver results while fostering a collaborative and innovative work environment.\n\nHey, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lazarkulasevic/)!\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS:\nTypescript, Javascript, Next, React, Vue, CSS, SCSS, PostCSS, HTML, Vite, Webpack, npm, pnpm, Node, Express, Vitest, Jest, Cypress, VitePress, Zod, Redux, Jotai, Github Actions, Jenkins, Docker, PostgreSQL, Cloud Firestore\n\nCONCEPTS & PLATFORMS:\nMicrofrontends, SSR, Vercel, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Google API, SonarQube, Azure Application Insights, GitFlow, Trunk-based Development, CI/CD, Feature Flags, Kanban, Scrum\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE:\n1.
